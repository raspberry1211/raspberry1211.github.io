"""
This script can be used to create a json file with an entry for each card in Fronts.
It pulls the card info from the various csv files in spreadsheets.
In order to get the necessary data, download each sheet from the mark 4 card spreadsheet 
as a csv file, then put those csv files into the spreadsheet folder. This script assumes
that the default name is used for each csv file.
